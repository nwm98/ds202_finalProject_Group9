## Background

Cereal is one of the most popular choices for breakfast in many places. Many cereals can be very healthy due to their vitamin and mineral content as well as containing fiber, protein and whole grain. On the other hand many can be unhealthy due to high sugar content and lack of healthy ingredients. Our group wanted to create a buyer's guide to help consumers choose the right cereal for their needs. In this report we will be exploring 80 different cereals and comparing them based on nutritional value, rating and quality.

1) Do people prefer hot or cold cereal based off of the rating?

To find this, I first made two filtered data sets of cold and hot cereals, and then printed the mean rating for both of these data sets. I realized this was not the best way to compare the ratings, so I decided to do a different approach.

I looked at the highest rated hot cereals, the highest rated cold cereals, and the highest rated cereals overall. I realized that only one of the 10 highest rated cereals was a hot cereal, the rest were cold.

Based on the rating, people prefer cold cereal, although hot cereal still had some high ratings. It is also hard to compare because there are 74 cold cereals and 3 hot cereals.

2) Which manufacturer has the highest average rating?

To find this, I made filtered data sets of all 7 of the manufacturers (American Home Food Products, General Mills, Kelloggs, Nabisco, Post, Quaker Oats, Ralston Purina). Then I printed the average/mean ratings for each filtered data set.

Nabisco is the manufacturer with the highest average rating. This makes sense, because five out of the 10 highest rated cereals are produced by Nabisco. Their cereals include 100% Bran, Cream of Wheat, Shredded Wheat, and Strawberry Fruit Wheats.

1. What is the healthiest cold cereal?

To figure this out, I used the "cold" filtered data set that Madalyn had previously created. After this, I used the order function to reformat the data set into a list that orders by fiber in descending order and sugars in ascending order. I used these two measurements because we had previously defined that a healthy cereal would be considered one that is high in fiber and low in sugar. From this list, I learned that All-Bran with Extra Fiber is the healthiest cold cereal, as it contains 14 grams of fiber and 0 sugars per serving.


2. What is the least healthiest cereal?

This was similar to my first question, so I only had to change a little bit. This time, I ordered the cold cereal data set by fiber in ascending and sugar in descending instead of vice-versa. This allowed me to see which cereals were highest in sugar and lowest in fiber, making them unhealthy by our standards. From this list, I learned that Golden Crisp is the least healthiest cold cereal, as it contains no fiber and 15 grams of sugar per serving.
