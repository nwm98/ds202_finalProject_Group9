1) Do people prefer hot or cold cereal based off of the rating?

To find this, I first made two filtered data sets of cold and hot cereals, and then printed the mean rating for both of these data sets. I realized this was not the best way to compare the ratings, so I decided to do a different approach.

I looked at the highest rated hot cereals, the highest rated cold cereals, and the highest rated cereals overall. I realized that only one of the 10 highest rated cereals was a hot cereal, the rest were cold.

Based on the rating, people prefer cold cereal, although hot cereal still had some high ratings. It is also hard to compare because there are 74 cold cereals and 3 hot cereals.

2) Which manufacturer has the highest average rating?

To find this, I made filtered data sets of all 7 of the manufacturers (American Home Food Products, General Mills, Kelloggs, Nabisco, Post, Quaker Oats, Ralston Purina). Then I printed the average/mean ratings for each filtered data set.

Nabisco is the manufacturer with the highest average rating. This makes sense, because five out of the 10 highest rated cereals are produced by Nabisco. Their cereals include 100% Bran, Cream of Wheat, Shredded Wheat, and Strawberry Fruit Wheats.
